# JSON-RPC API

### What is a JSON-RPC API?

This is the specification for the API that is run by [API Endpoints](/develop-on-icon-chain/networks#rpc-endpoints), which are made available for users to interact with the ICON blockchain. This implementation on the endpoints supports [remote procedure calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) written in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.
